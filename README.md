# Create README

## Project Overview

This project provides a Python script to automate the generation of README.md files for software projects. The script analyzes the project's directory structure and file names to infer essential information and generate a comprehensive and well-formatted README. 

## Features

- **Automatic README generation**: Analyzes project structure to create a structured README.md file.
- **Environment manager and package manager detection**: Automatically identifies tools like `conda`, `virtualenv`, `pip`, `npm`, and `yarn` to provide accurate installation instructions.
- **Dependency detection**: Detects files like `requirements.txt` and `package.json` to include necessary dependencies in the installation section.
- **Customizable template**: Allows users to tailor the generated README to their specific needs.

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.6 or higher

**Installation using pip:**

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To generate a README.md file for your project:

1. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
2. Run the following command:
```bash
python create-readme.py
```

This will generate a `README.md` file in the project directory.
